# VH Takehome Q&A Test

The goal is to create a simple Q&A API using Symfony (4.\*) and NelmioApiDocBundle
The table structure is as follows:

- a questions table: id, question, rank (number)
- an answer table: id, answer_id, answer, tags (string)

The API needs to have a GET route where one can request the questions with pagination as well as ability to sort by rank
Another GET route for answers.
We need POST routes for creating a question and adding answers as well.
The answer needs to be sent with a docker image

We are looking for

- use of PHP 7.\* syntax
- consistency and clean code
- proper use of models, entities, repositories, controllers, etc.

For bonus points you can write tests.

# My notes

In my opinion there were some inconsistencies in instruction.

- The answer.tags database column is said to be a string, but returns as an array in the example JSON. The API Accepts a string as input, it is stored as a string, but it is casted as a comma-delimited array upon retrieval.

- There is no slug mentioned in the database design, but there is a slug returned for each question. Since I had already used a cast for another instance, I opted to use a package I VERY often pull in for slugs, spatie/laravel-sluggable for the Question model.

- The answer table shows an answer_id, but certainly what is intended here is a question_id to show which question an answer is attached to. This change is reflected in my migrations.

- The API description mentions a separate GET route for answers and questions, but in the example JSON they are both shown with each other. I have opted to show all answers with GET /questions, and show no questions with GET /answers.

# Config

I have limited experience with Docker. If this isn't what you were expecting...sorry!

Copy the .env contents to /src/.env

<details>
  <summary>.env</summary>

```env
APP_NAME="Vehicle History Q&A Challenge"
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost:8080
APP_TIMEZONE=UTC

LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret

CACHE_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
```

</details>

## Initialize Docker

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-composer up -d
```

Seed the database, if desired

```bash
docker-compose exec php php /var/www/html/artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

For the generated API docs, navigate to http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html

No, they aren't generated by NelmioApiDocBundle, but
